# Persistent Homology Analysis for Spectroscopic Data

This project applies persistent homology analysis, specifically Vietoris-Rips complexes and persistence diagrams, to spectroscopic data. 

The data represents absorption at different wavelengths, and we explore the structure of these data points using tools from computational topology.
